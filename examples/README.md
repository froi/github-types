# Examples

You can find a simple example on how to use this types library in the index.ts file.

## How to run this example

1. Run `npm install`; This will install all dependencies need to run the example

  You can see the dependencies in the [package.json](package.json). One of the dependencies is Typescript itself. You might want to install this globally on your machine. If that is something you don't want then please just install it locally (for the example folder).

2. Run `npm build`: This will build the Typescript file into a `index.js`
3. Run `npm start`: This will run the built `index.js` file.
